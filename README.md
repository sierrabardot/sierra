# Hi there, I'm Sierra! ðŸ‘‹

Based in Melbourne, Australia, I am currently completing an immersive Software Engineering bootcamp via General Assembly. Welcome to my GitHub!

## About Me
I'm a curious soul who loves exploring and pondering the endless possibilities that the world of software engineering has to offer. With a background in customer experience, I approach app development with a user-centric mindset. Responsive web design is a key element in my process, so I ensure that my apps are not only visually appealing but also accessible across devices.

## Projects

### 1. Freshco: Inventory & Recipe Management
Freshco. is a web app designed for small businesses. Manage inventory, create recipes, and track food productions seamlessly. Technologies used include MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and EJS for templating.

### 2. Memory Game: A Walk Through Nature

Engage your memory skills with this modern twist on the classic matching game. I handled game logic, implemented an overlay feature, and used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for captivating animations.
