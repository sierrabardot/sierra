# Hi there, I'm Sierra! ðŸ‘‹

Based in Melbourne, Australia, I am currently completing an immersive Software Engineering bootcamp via General Assembly. Welcome to my GitHub!

## About Me
I'm a curious soul who loves exploring and pondering the endless possibilities that the world of software engineering has to offer. With a background in customer experience, I approach app development with a user-centric mindset. Responsive web design is a key element in my process, so I ensure that my apps are not only visually appealing but also accessible across devices.
